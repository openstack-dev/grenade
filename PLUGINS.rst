==============================
 Modular Grenade Architecture
==============================

Grenade was originally created to demonstrate some level of upgrade
capacity for OpenStack projects. Originally this just included a small
number of services.

Proposed new basic flow:

- setup_grenade
  - all the magic setup involved around err traps and filehandle redirects
  - setup devstack trees
- setup_base
  - run stack.sh to build the correct base environment
- verify_base
  - for project in projects; do verify_project; done
- resources.sh create
- resources.sh verify pre-upgrade
- shutdown
  - for project in projects; do shutdown; done
- snapshot.sh pre_upgrade (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
- resources.sh verify_noapi pre-upgrade
- upgrade ...
- resources.sh verify post-upgrade
- verify_target
- resources.sh destroy



Modular Components
==================

Assuming the following tree in target projects::

  devstack/    - devstack plugin directory
     upgrade/   - upgrade scripts
         settings   - adds settings for the upgrade path
         upgrade.sh
         snapshot.sh - snapshots the state of the service, typically a
            database dump (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
         from-juno/ - per release
         within-juno/
         from-kilo/
         within-kilo/
         resources.sh


This same modular structure exists in the grenade tree with::
  grenade/
     projects/
        10_ceilometer/
           settings
           upgrade.sh

resources.sh
=================

resources.sh is a per-service resource create / verify / destroy
interface. What a service does inside a script is up to them.

You can assume your resource script will only be called if your
service is running in an upgrade environment. The script should return
zero on success for actions, and nonzero on failure.

Calling Interface
-----------------

The following is the supported calling interface

- resources.sh early_create

  creates a set of sample resources that should survive very early in
  the upgrade process. This should only be used for horizontal
  resources that impact other services, that *have* to be available
  before they do any of their setup. For instance setup of neutron
  networks.

  Do not use the phase unless you really know why ``create`` will not
  work for you.

- resources.sh create

  creates a set of sample resources that should survive
  upgrade. Script should exit with a nonzero exit code if any
  resources could not be created.

  Example: create an instance in nova or a volume in cinder

- resources.sh verify (pre-upgrade|post-upgrade)

  verify that the resources were created. Services are running at this
  point, and the APIs may be expected to work. The second argument
  indicates whether we are pre-upgrade or post-upgrade.

  Example: use the nova command to verify that the test instance is
  still ACTIVE, or the cinder command to verify that the volume is
  still available.

- resources.sh verify_noapi

  verify that the resources are still present. This is called in the
  phase where services are stopped, and APIs are expected to not be
  accessible. Resource verification at this phase my require probing
  underlying components to make sure nothing has gone awry during
  service shutdown. The second argument indicates whether we are
  pre-upgrade or post-upgrade.

  Example: check with libvirt to make sure the instance is actually
  created and running. Bonus points for being able to ping the
  instance, or otherwise check its live-ness. With cinder, checking
  that the LVM volume exists and looks reasonable.

- resources.sh destroy

  Resource scripts should be responsible and cleanup all their
  resources when asked to destroy.

Calling Sequence
----------------

The calling sequence during a grenade run looks as follows:

- # start old side
- create (create will be called during the working old side)
- verify pre-upgrade
- # shutdown all services
- verify_noapi pre-upgrade
- # upgrade and start all services
- verify post-upgrade
- destroy

The important thing to remember is verify/verify_noapi will be called
multiple times, with multiple different versions of OpenStack. Those
phases of the script must not be rerunnable multiple times.

While create / destroy are only going to be called once in the current
interface, bonus points for also making those idempotent for
resiliancy in testing.

**Per-release upgrade scripts**

There are times when :ref:`exceptional <upgrade-exceptions>` manual upgrade
steps must be performed to get from one release to the next, or even within
the same release. Grenade supports this with per-release scripts found in
each project, e.g.::

    projects/
        60_nova/
            from-ocata/
                upgrade-nova

Regarding the sequence of when these per-release scripts are called, any
``within-$base`` script should be run *before* installing new code, and any
``from-$base`` script should be run *after* installing new code but before
starting the services with the new code. This is because configuration or
database changes may be needed before the upgraded code is started.

Supporting Methods
------------------

In order to assist with the checks listed the following functions
exist::

  resource_save project key value
  resource_get project key

This allow resource scripts to have memory, and keep track of things
like the allocated IP addresses, IDs, and other non deterministic data
that is returned from OpenStack API calls.

Environment
-----------

Resource scripts get called in a specific environment already set:

- TOP_DIR - will be set to the root of the devstack directory for the
  BASE version of devstack incase this is needed to find files like a
  working ``openrc``

- GRENADE_DIR - the root directory of the grenade directory.

The following snippet will give you access to both the grenade and
TARGET devstack functions::

  source $GRENADE_DIR/grenaderc
  source $GRENADE_DIR/functions


Best Practices
--------------

Do as many actions as non admin as possible. As early as you can in
your resource script it's worth allocating a user/project for the
script to run as. This ensures isolation against other scripts, and
ensures that actions don't only work because admin gets to bypass
safeties.

Test side effects, not just API actions. The point of these resource
survival scripts is to test that things created beyond the API / DB
interaction still work later. Just testing that data can be stored /
retrieved from the database isn't very interesting, and should be
covered other places. The value in the resource scripts is these side
effects. Actual VMs running, actual iscsi targets running, etc. And
ensuring these things are not disrupted when the control plane is
shifted out from under them.

Out of Tree Plugins
===================

A grenade plugin can be hosted out of tree in a project tree, similar
to external devstack plugins. There are a few subtle differences when
this happens.

The plugin structure will live under ``$project/devstack/upgrade/``
directory.

The plugin is enabled by adding::

  enable_grenade_plugin <$project> <giturl> [branch]

To ``pluginrc`` in the ``GRENADE_DIR``. An additional rc file was
required due to sequencing of when plugin functions become available.

Note: when running a job based on the ``grenade-base`` job,
for each devstack plugin defined using the ``devstack_plugins``,
the corresponding grenade plugin is enabled automatically.


Changing Devstack Localrc
-------------------------

There is also a mechanism that allows a ``settings`` file change the
devstack localrc files with the ``devstack_localrc`` function.

::
   devstack_localrc <base|target> arbitrary stuff to add

Which will take all the rest of the stuff on that line and add it to
the localrc for either the base or target devstack.

Please note that ``devstack_localrc`` only works when grenade
performs the configuration of the devstack settings and runs devstack
against the base target. When GRENADE_USE_EXTERNAL_DEVSTACK is set
to True, as it happens on the Zuul grenade jobs where devstack is
configured and executed before grenade, the function has no effect.

Example settings
----------------

The following is a reasonable example ``settings`` for out of tree
plugin::

  register_project_for_upgrade heat
  register_db_to_save heat
  devstack_localrc base enable_service h-api h-api-cfn h-api-cw h-eng heat
  devstack_localrc target enable_service h-api h-api-cfn h-api-cw h-eng heat

This registers the project for upgrade, symbolicly enables the heat
database for dump during upgrade, and adds the heat services into the
service list for base and target.

It's expected that most ``settings`` files for out of tree plugins
will need equivalent lines.
