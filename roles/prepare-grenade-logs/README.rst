Move the logs and other data files which are relevant
for the starting and destination branches, which are
generated by devstack, grenade and tempest.
This role is needed because stage-output does not support
duplicated file names, even if they come from different
directories.

**Role Variables**

.. zuul:rolevar:: grenade_devstack_shared_dir

   The grenade base shared directory.

.. zuul:rolevar:: grenade_config_dir

   The grenade base directory of the deployment.

.. zuul:rolevar:: grenade_save_data_dir

   The final name of the directory which should store
   the content of the save/ directory generated by grenade.

.. zuul:rolevar:: grenade_devstack_data_log_dirs
   :type: dict

   A dictionary with two keys ('old' and 'new'). Each
   value contains the directory used to store the configuration
   and data files from the corresponding devstack settings.

.. zuul:rolevar:: grenade_devstack_saved_files
   :type: list

   A list of files (base names only, no directories) to be saved
   from the devstack directories.
   The list is added to the default set of saved files
   (defined as grenade_devstack_saved_files_default).
